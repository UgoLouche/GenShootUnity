# GenShootUnity

This is a demo space shooter in Unity 3D based on the Unity 3D tutorial. The twist lies in the fact that ennemies waves are generated from a genetic algorithm. Each wave is then evalutated based on how it performed against the player. 

*Work In progress, most (if not all) of the key mechanics are missing for now*

Current state: 
- Ship Control
- Static Ennemy Spawn
- Ennemy move Pattern
- Weapon/Projectile/Damage
- Drop/Loot implemention (*in progress*)



*Most of 2D arts are not mine and freely available. If you see something here that shouldn't be publicly available and/or wrongly credited, please contact me.*
